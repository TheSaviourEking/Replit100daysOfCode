# ðŸ‘‰ Day 8 Challenge

## Affirmations (or insults) Generator

Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:
- input and output
- concatenation
- if statements
- nested if statements

Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week.

1. Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favorite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.

2. The goal is to generate a unique message for each day of the week based on the user's answers.

4. If affirmations are not your jam, then you could do a daily joke or insult. Please don't be mean. Keep it light and funny.


5. Final challenge: Can you create if statements that do not care about capital or lowercase letters of names.
